# Weather-Prediction

**Project Overview**
In this project, we will predict tomorrows temperature using historical data. We will start by downloading a dataset of local weather. You can customize this to your own location. Then, we will clean the data and get it ready for machine learning. W]e will build a system to make historical predictions. Then, we will add more predictors to improve the model. We wil end with how to make next-day predictions.
